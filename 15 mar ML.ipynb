    "Q1: Explain the following with an example:\n",
    "a) Artificial Intelligence:- Artificial Intelligence is the capibility of a machine or computer to learn things from the environment and then performing desire output, example:- robotic hands are made to separate non recyclable garbage from the recyclable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learnin:- It is the subset of Artificial Intelligence where we feed the data to the machine and the machine recognise the patterns by developing models and then predict result as per requirement. It is of three type, a) Supervised leaning:- Data with labels are feeded to machine and then machine gives classified categories or values according to data provided to it\n",
    "I) Deep Learning :- It is a process of mimicing human brain such that it can handle complex problems with the helps of neural mesh and predict result, Deep learning is working good with large data and visual recognisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- The name Supervised learning coined from the word superviser means the data is labled and them feeded to the machine, the machine have to learn the data and then give the output after learning the trend behind the data The goal is to learn a function that can map the input to the output, so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In unsupervised learning the data is not labled and generally used to categorised the data in various categories so that some information can we obtained, example suppose a mole gives the data of customers purchasing the items in mole with all details, then we can classified person according to what they buy , which type of customers are more comming at which time so we can shift our staff where that group is comming, which group of people purchasing which things so that we can suggest similar types of people the trending things\n",

    "d) DS (Data Science) is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistical and computational techniques with domain-specific knowledge and expertise to extract insights and knowledge from data. Data science involves the use of a variety of tools and techniques, including statistical modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and data mining, to analyze and interpret data and inform decision-making.\n",

    "Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, the model is provided with both labeled and unlabeled data, and the goal is to use the unlabeled data to improve the performance of the model on the labeled data. This is particularly useful in situations where obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning algorithms typically combine unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, such as clustering and classification.\n",

    "Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set is the subset of the data used to train the machine learning model. It is the largest subset and used to build the model by adjusting its parameters. The model learns from the data in the training set, and its performance improves with more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing set is the subset of the data used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It is used to estimate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. The testing set should be large enough to give a good estimate of the model's performance, but not so large that it takes too long to evaluate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation set is the subset of the data used to tune the hyperparameters of the machine learning model. Hyperparameters are the parameters that are not learned during training, such as learning rate or regularization strength. The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance with different hyperparameters and select the best set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual patterns or events in data that deviate from normal behavior. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given a dataset without any labels or annotations. The algorithm must discover patterns and structures in the data on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach in unsupervised learning for anomaly detection is to use clustering algorithms to group similar data points together. Clustering algorithms such as k-means or DBSCAN can be used to group data points based on their similarity. Once the data points have been grouped, anomalies can be identified as points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to a cluster with significantly fewer points than the other clusters.\n",
