    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Elastic Net Regression is combination of both lasso and redge regression, hence it shrinks the coefficients and also make it to zero if feature is not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- The regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression are alpha and l1_ratio. Alpha controls the overall strength of regularization, while l1_ratio controls the balance between L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps to address the issue of multicollinearity in input features.\n",
    "Performs well in high-dimensional datasets with a large number of features.\n",
    "Provides a balance between L1 and L2 regularization, which can lead to better performance compared to using only one type of regularization.\n",
    "Can select important features and remove redundant features, leading to a more interpretable model.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires choosing the values of the regularization parameters, which can be a challenging task.\n",
    "Can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets or when searching for the optimal values of the regularization parameters.\n",
    "Assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, which may not hold true in some cases.\n",
    "May not perform as well as other non-linear regression techniques, such as tree-based models or neural networks, in capturing complex non-linear relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Genomics: Elastic Net Regression has been used in genomics to identify genetic markers that are associated with diseases or traits. By selecting important genetic features and removing redundant ones, Elastic Net Regression can help to improve the accuracy of disease prediction models. few cases are :- \n",

    "Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- To interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression, it's important to look at their magnitude and sign. A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the corresponding input feature will lead to an increase in the target variable, while a negative coefficient indicates that an increase in the input feature will lead to a decrease in the target variable. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship between the input feature and the target variable, after accounting for the effects of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- we can handle missing values by removing them if they are small in quantity compare to the overall dataset, we can replace it by mean, median or mode, we can cluster the data set into groups and the give the mean value of that group, we can make another column to represent the missing value information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- as Elastic Net Regression combined of lasso and ridge, we use lasso for feature sellection, it makes the value fo feature to zero where feature are not related.\n",
