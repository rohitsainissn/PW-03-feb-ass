    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- as we know machine learning model works only on numerical data hence when we have nominal data or categorical data then we use one hot encoding to convert categorical to numeric formate. When we have ordinal data then we use ordinal encoding.\n",
    "it is very useful in data science as the model can work on numerical data hence it can be trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- nominal encoding is to replace the categories with numerical array where the categories have no herercial structure like color, fruits, subjects.\n",
    "red, green, yellow is encoded as 1,2,3\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with categorical variables that have a large number of distinct categories, as one-hot encoding can lead to a large number of new features that can be computationally expensive and lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a dataset containing information about cities in the world. One categorical variable in the dataset is the country in which each city is located. Suppose there are 200 countries in the dataset, and we want to use this variable as a feature in a machine learning model. Using one-hot encoding, we would create 200 new binary features, one for each country, resulting in a high-dimensional feature space. This can lead to computational and memory issues when training the model, especially if the dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, nominal encoding would assign a unique integer value to each country, which can be used as a feature in the machine learning model. This results in a lower-dimensional feature space compared to one-hot encoding and can be computationally efficient."
