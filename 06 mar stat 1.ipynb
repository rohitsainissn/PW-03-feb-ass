    "Q1. What is Statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves the use of mathematical tools and techniques to analyze and draw conclusions from data. Statistics plays a crucial role in various fields such as business, economics, medicine, social sciences, and many others."

    "Nominal level of measurement: This level of measurement involves variables that are classified into categories or groups without any specific order or ranking. Examples of nominal variables include gender (male, female), eye color (blue, brown, green), and race (White, Black, Asian, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal level of measurement: This level of measurement involves variables that can be ranked or ordered but do not have a consistent or known distance between them. Examples of ordinal variables include levels of education (elementary, high school, college, graduate), levels of satisfaction (poor, fair, good, excellent), and socioeconomic status (low, middle, high).\n",

    "Interval level of measurement: This level of measurement involves variables that can be ranked or ordered and have a consistent distance between each value, but do not have a true zero point. Examples of interval variables include temperature (measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit), time (measured in hours, minutes, or seconds), and IQ scores.\n",
    "\n",
